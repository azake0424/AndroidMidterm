When you get older,
Plainer, saner
Will you remember all the danger
We came from?
Burning like embers,
Falling, tender
Longing for the days of no surrender
Years ago
And well you know
[Pre-Chorus]
Smoke em if you got em
Cause it’s going down
All I ever wanted was you
I’ll never get to heaven
Cause I don’t know how
Let’s raise a glass
Or two
[Chorus]
To all the things I’ve lost on you
Tell me are they lost on you
Just that you could cut me loose
After everything I’ve lost on you
Is that lost on you
Is that lost on you
Baby is that lost on you
Is that lost on you
[Verse 2]
Wishin’ I could see the machinations
Understand the toil of expectations
In your mind
Hold me like you never
lost your patience
Tell me that you love me more
Than hate me all the time
And you’re still mine
[Pre-chorus]
So smoke ’em if you got ’em
Cause it’s going down
All I ever wanted was you
Let’s take a drink
Of ever this can turn around
Let’s raise a glass
Or two

[Chorus]
To all the things I’ve lost on you
Tell me are they lost on you
Just that you could cut me loose
After everything I’ve lost on you
Is that lost on you
Is that lost on you
Baby is that lost on you
Is that lost on you

[Instrumental & solo]
Let’s raise a glass
Or two

[Chorus]
To all the things I’ve lost on you
Tell me are they lost on you
Trusted you could cut me loose
After everything I’ve lost on you
Is that lost on you
Is that lost on you
